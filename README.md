# XOR Encryption in C++
An implementation of simple XOR encryption in C++.

Learned how to do it from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KdvcQKNfbQ). I know it's incredibly simple, but after hearing about XOR encryption in the past but never taking the time to learn it, I was so astounded by how simple it is that I had to implement it. It has also given me an excuse to try out Neovim on real project, which is what was used to create the files in this repo.
